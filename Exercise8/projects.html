                                This Project is based on Publish/Subscribe system and was created in terms of course <i>Distributed Systems</i> in the 6th semester of Departement of Computer Science @ AUEB.

                                    <b>Publish/Subscribe System</b>
                                    is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers,
                                    do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers,
                                    called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes
                                    without knowledge of which subscribers.
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                    In fact, in this system, publishers
                                    connect with brokers which forward the message to the subscriber that want 
                                    to take the message. Subscribers express interest in one or more classes and 
                                    only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which 
                                    publishers, if any, there are.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In this project, We want to gather the 
                                    real-time bus location information. We don't have real-time data ,so publishers 
                                    have to read a txt file named "busLinesNew" which is located in DS_project_dataset
                                    folder and has location data from greek buses. Brokers distribute the topics
                                    (bus lines) according to their hashed number. Also,an Android application has 
                                    been made for Subscribers.
                                </p>

                                It's a simple game written in Java using the <b>Min-Max Algorithm</b>.

                                Min-Max algorithm is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"—to maximize the minimum gain.
